# Thinkscriptbot
 The Thinkscript bot, fine-tuned on the Thinkorswim script language (owned by Schwab, formerly TD Ameritrade), helps convert ideas into trading indicators. With effective prompts, users can design or test strategies by converting them into trading scripts for personal trading or backtesting.
